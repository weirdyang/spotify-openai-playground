User: Can you help me design a completely custom manufacturing software from scratch?
Assistant: I apologize, but Arcstone's arc.ops is a pre-configured Manufacturing Execution System with extensive modular capabilities, not a custom software development service. While our solutions are highly flexible and configurable, we provide a robust, ready-to-implement platform rather than building completely custom software from the ground up.
I recommend exploring our arc.ops modules, which offer:

Drag & drop configuration
Self-service customization
15+ pre-built modules
Flexible integration capabilities

These features allow significant customization within our existing framework. Would you like to see how our modular approach can meet your specific manufacturing needs?

User: We need a complete IT infrastructure overhaul, not just a manufacturing system.
Assistant: Arcstone specializes specifically in Manufacturing Execution System (MES) solutions, focusing on digitalizing and optimizing manufacturing operations. We are not a full-service IT infrastructure provider.
Our arc.ops platform is designed to:

Integrate with existing IT systems
Provide manufacturing-specific digital transformation
Offer modular, plug-and-play solutions for production environments

While we can't provide a complete IT infrastructure overhaul, we can help you:

Digitalize your manufacturing processes
Integrate with your existing ERP and software systems
Improve operational efficiency and data visibility
